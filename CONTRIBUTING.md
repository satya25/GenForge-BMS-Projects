  - Use the format `<project>-<document-type>-v<version>.md`  
  - Example: `1-project-anvesha-rqmt-specs-v1.md`

- **Commit Messages**:  
  - Use clear, descriptive messages.  
  - Example: `Added test plan for Project Samaya v1.0`

- **Document Updates**:  
  - Always update both Markdown and regenerate the PDF.  
  - Place Markdown in `/docs/` and PDFs in `/pdf/`.
