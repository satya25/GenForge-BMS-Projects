# Project Prabodha – Executive Summary

## 1. Vision & Purpose
Prabodha is envisioned as the institute’s intelligent learning companion. Its purpose is to provide students with guided practice, personalized feedback, and adaptive learning pathways. It bridges the gap between classroom teaching and self-study by offering structured exercises aligned with course outcomes and Bloom’s taxonomy.

## 2. Objectives
- Deliver adaptive practice sessions tailored to student performance.
- Provide instant feedback and hints to reinforce learning.
- Track progress against course outcomes and Bloom’s levels.
- Enable faculty to monitor student engagement and learning gaps.
- Integrate with Samaya (time management) and Anvesha (analytics).

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope:**
- Student practice modules (MCQs, short answers, problem-solving).
- Adaptive difficulty adjustment based on performance.
- Faculty dashboards for monitoring student progress.
- Integration with question bank metadata from Yojanā.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Automated exam paper generation (handled by Yojanā).
- Accreditation reporting (handled by Anvesha).
- Full-fledged LMS features (grading, attendance, etc.).

## 4. Stakeholders
- **Students:** access guided practice, receive feedback, track progress.
- **Faculty:** monitor student learning outcomes, identify weak areas.
- **HODs:** oversee department-level adoption and effectiveness.
- **Academic Council:** evaluate learning impact for curriculum improvements.

## 5. Key Features
- Adaptive learning engine with difficulty scaling.
- Personalized feedback and hints for each question.
- Progress tracking against Bloom’s taxonomy and CO mappings.
- Faculty dashboards with student-level analytics.
- Integration with Yojanā’s question bank for practice material.

## 6. Success Criteria
- ≥70% student adoption within the first semester.
- Demonstrated improvement in learning outcomes (≥15% score increase).
- Faculty reporting accuracy within ±5% of actual performance.
- Positive student feedback (≥8/10 satisfaction rating).
- Seamless integration with Yojanā and Anvesha.

## 7. Roadmap Snapshot
- **MVP:** Basic practice modules with static feedback.
- **Phase I:** Adaptive difficulty engine and faculty dashboards.
- **Phase II:** Personalized learning pathways and analytics integration.
- **Phase III:** Full-scale predictive learning insights and ERP integration.
