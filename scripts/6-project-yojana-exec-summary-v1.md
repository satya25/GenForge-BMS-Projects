# Project Yojanā – Executive Summary

## 1. Vision & Purpose
Yojanā is the institute’s GenAI-enabled exam paper generation system. Its purpose is to automate the creation of compliant, balanced, and secure exam papers from curated question banks. By integrating with Sangrah (archival), Viveka (evaluation), and Anvesha (analytics), Yojanā ensures that exam papers are generated fairly, efficiently, and in alignment with course outcomes and Bloom’s taxonomy.

## 2. Objectives
- Automate exam paper generation with blueprint compliance.
- Ensure balanced distribution of difficulty levels and Bloom’s taxonomy coverage.
- Provide secure workflows for paper generation, validation, and download.
- Enable faculty to generate multiple statistically equivalent paper variants.
- Integrate seamlessly with Sangrah, Viveka, and Anvesha for end-to-end exam lifecycle management.

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope:**
- Blueprint-driven paper generation.
- Automated compliance checks for Bloom’s levels and CO mappings.
- Secure paper validation and download workflows.
- Integration with Sangrah (archival) and Viveka (evaluation).

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Student practice modules (handled by Prabodha).
- Accreditation reporting (handled by Anvesha).
